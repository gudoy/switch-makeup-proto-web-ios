This project is a prototype/demo made in 2013 for a famous makeup brand to showcase interactive BEFORE/AFTER of some of their products.
It was intended to be embedded in an iOS hybrid app for iPad (hence the 1024x768 format).

For each product, a video will be launched. It will show a face with and/or without the product applied.
While you play with (move) the product in the area below the video, a divider will move accordingly in the video area, with
- the LEFT part of the divider showing the "makeup" applied
- the RIGHT part of the divider showing no makeup
